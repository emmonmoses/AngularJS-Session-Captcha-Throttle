When a user is idle after some time, a popud dialog modal for the countdown appears,
prompting the user if he needs to continue with the session else, the user is signed out of the app.

Am generating random sets of letters, which if it matches your captcha-an alert "true" appears, else, alert "false" appears.

Am suspending the user for 2 minutes from accessing the login page to the application, after she has made 3 wrong login attempts.
